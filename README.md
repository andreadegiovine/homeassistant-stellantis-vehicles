## Commands
### WakeUp
For some vehicles no updates are received a few minutes after the engine is turned off. Use automations like these to schedule the vehicle wake up:

```yaml
- id: "standby_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle standby WakeUp (every 1 hour)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      hours: /1
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "off"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```

```yaml
- id: "charging_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle charging WakeUp (every 5 minutes)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      minutes: /5
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "on"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```
\* the entity names above are in english, please use your language entity names.

**Some users report that performing too many wakeups drains the service battery, making some features unavailable (such as keyless entry).**

### Air conditioning Start/Stop
As described in the Stellantis apps, the command is enabled when:
1. the vehicle engine is off;
2. the vehicle doors are locked;
3. the battery level is at least 50% (20% for hybrids) or in charging.

### Air conditioning Start/Stop - Charge Start/Stop - Doors
These commands depend on the relative binary sensor, before send the opposite command please wait until the relative sensor state change.

## ABRP - A Better Routeplanner
Get a token from [ABRP](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/):
1. login to your account;
2. navigate to vehicle settings;
3. navigate to real time data;
4. navigate to edit connections;
5. generate a token using "Generic" method;

Use the generated token in **abrp_token sensor** and enable **abrp_sync switch** to send updates.

## Battery capacity / residual sensors:
Thanks to the community ([#272](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/272)), it seems that for some vehicles **Stellantis provides incorrect values**. The **switch.battery_values_correction** entity (in your language) applies a correction if active.

\* currently only to the battery_residual sensor

## Errors
Before any issue request, please check the integration log and look for solution below.

### OTP error - NOK:MAXNBTOOLS
It seems that this error is due to reaching the limit of associated devices / SMS received. Restore your Stellantis account and try again:
[Follow this procedure from Peugeot community](https://peugeot.my-customerportal.com/peugeot/s/article/AP-I-have-problems-with-the-pin-safety-code-or-I-want-to-change-it-What-can-I-do?language=en_GB).

**<u>This operation removes the devices connected to your vehicle, no vehicle data will be lost.</u>**

### OTP error - NOK:NOK_BLOCKED
It seems that this error is due to reaching the limit of wrong PIN used. Re-authenticate the integration.
