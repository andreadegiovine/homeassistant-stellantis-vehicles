## WakeUp
For some vehicles no updates are received a few minutes after the engine is turned off. Use automations like these to schedule the vehicle wake up:

```yaml
- id: "standby_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle standby WakeUp (every 1 hour)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      hours: /1
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "off"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```

```yaml
- id: "charging_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle charging WakeUp (every 5 minutes)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      minutes: /5
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "on"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```

**Some users report that performing too many wakeups drains the service battery, making some features unavailable (such as keyless entry).**

## Air conditioning Start/Stop
As described in the Stellantis apps, the command is enabled when:
1. the vehicle engine is off;
2. the vehicle doors are locked;
3. the battery level is at least 50% (20% for hybrids) or in charging.

## ABRP - A Better Routeplanner
Get a token from [ABRP](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/):
1. login to your account;
2. navigate to vehicle settings;
3. navigate to real time data;
4. navigate to edit connections;
5. generate a token using "Generic" method;

Use the generated token in **abrp_token sensor** and enable **abrp_sync switch** to send updates.

## Errors
### OTP error - NOK:MAXNBTOOLS
It seems that this error is due to reaching the limit of associated devices / SMS received. Restore your Stellantis account and try again:
